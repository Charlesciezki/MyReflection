Today 4-25-16 I took an exam and i think it went really well, I also got assigned a roject, which has been approved for us to go and work on. We have started the stubbing proess adn have started laying everything out to work on. We have it layed out half day by half day. And I think it'll work very wel for the group as we are all good workers/coders.

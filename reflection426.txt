Today 4-26-16 I worked a lot on learning the ASP.NET MVC. It's been very chalenging thus far and I hope that we can get this done, but with this group I'm certain we'll be able to get this done in time. According to our scope, we're off by an entire day and a half and I'm preying that there is an extention. But I'm sure there won't be. Oh well. We got a lecture on APIs so that is good as well.

Today 3-8-16 we learned about ArrayLists and how to better use them. I'm feeling better so far on Java, it's tough but I just need to better learn the verbage. We were assigned a partner project, it's coming together very well thus far! I'm not worries about this project which is a first! Today I also start my tutoringw which will be a great thing!

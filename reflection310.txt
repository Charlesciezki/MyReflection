Today 3-10-16 my partner Justin and I turned in our dice game project and although it didn't turn out the way I would have liked, I learned a ton about Java in the process. I was making plenty of simple mistakes which I learned from. I also learned the real power of "Stubbing". Stubbing is laying out the bare bones of your entire program, so that means filling out classes, methods, and variables. It is already a major help as I have stubbed out my new project in about an hour and a half, which for me is great because I work slow. Today was a success, I lerned a lot.

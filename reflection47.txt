Today 4-7-16 I struggled all day, it was a grueling day fo rme. I don't feel like I know what I'm doing anymore with my project. I think I may jus tbe burnt out, which means I jsut need to buckle down even more. This program is so intense and stressful, but I am learning a lot. Tomorrow I will be requesting more lectures from instructors in their spare time. I hope tomorrow will prove to be a more productive day.

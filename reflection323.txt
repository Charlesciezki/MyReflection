Today 3-23-16 we got additional problems to solve, I solved one with minor ease but the other problem took all day, thus making me feel like I wasted a day here in school. I feel like I wasted it because we also got a PROJECT assigned to us today, which I didn't get to work on at all. But I digress, I did learn about 2d lists, and better variable placement and I got more knowlege on Visual Studio 2015.

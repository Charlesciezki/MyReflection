Today 4-24-16 I accomplished a lot, I finished my lab problems that i needed to get caught up on and I feel very good about that because I was very worried yesterday abotu that. I was sick yesterday, so I am better now but still a bit sick. Oh well. It feels great that i came in today ready to kick butt, and I did :)

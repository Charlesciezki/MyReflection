Today I learned how to better lay out an HTML5 page, and upon doing this I revamped my old website all while creating a NEW website for a game I'm currently addicted to "The Long Dark" In that website I have game reviews, videos, and links to buy it. I also learned about CSS and how to make more effective styles sheets. I am looking forward to tomorrow and getting to learn how to make an EVEN better website. I'd have to say that HTML is my favorite language to work with thus far.
